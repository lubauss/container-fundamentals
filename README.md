# Week 1: Docker Optimization and Deployment Project

## 🎯 Project Overview
The project for week 1 involved optimizing a Docker container to efficiently serve a static website. The primary goal was to reduce the Docker image size while ensuring the web server runs effectively.

## 🛠️ Technical Review
- **Base Image Change**: Switched from `Ubuntu 22.04` to `Alpine latest` to reduce the base image size significantly.
- **Dockerfile Optimization**: Utilized Alpine's package manager with `--no-cache` option to keep the image lean.
- **Nginx Configuration**: Updated to correctly serve static content, resolving a `403 Forbidden` error.

## 📉 Size Reduction Achievements
- Reduced the Docker image size from **184MB** to **8.86MB**, enhancing deployment speed and resource efficiency.

## 📘 Learning Milestones
- **Understanding Docker Image Layers**: Explored how different base images and commands affect the final image size.
- **Nginx Configuration**: Learned to troubleshoot and configure Nginx within Docker to serve web content properly.

## 🚧 Challenges
- **403 Forbidden Error**: Encountered and resolved this issue by adjusting Nginx settings and verifying directory permissions.

## 🌟 Successful Outcomes
- Successfully deployed a Docker container that serves a static website with significantly reduced image size.
- Enhanced understanding of Docker's operational efficiency and best practices in web server configuration.

## 🛠️ Next Steps
- **Explore Kubernetes**: To manage multiple containers more efficiently.
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Regularly test and optimize Docker container performance.
